Dear Survey Participant

You recently very kindly completed an online survey for us about your
use of a mySociety website and also indicated that you would be
willing to participate in a follow-up stage of the research. We are
contacting you now to see whether you would be willing to take part
in the second phase by completing another short survey about your use
of the site(s) and a range of online and offline activities. This
follow-up is being done so that we can gain a fuller picture of
whether and how you may have benefited from using the mySociety
websites. This second survey shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to
complete. Your individual responses will not be reported as part of
the overall findings and never used in a way that could identify you.
