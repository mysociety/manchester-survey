Dear Survey Participant

We recently contacted you about completing a follow up survey about the
use of mySociety websites. We're just contacting you to remind you about
this. We won't contact you again about this survey.

This follow-up is being done so that we can gain a fuller picture of
whether and how you may have benefited from using the mySociety websites.
Completing the survey shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. Your individual
responses will not be reported as part of the overall findings and never
used in a way that could identify you.

This survey is one of the last phases of our research project. We will
be contacting again a few respondents after the summer to find volunteers
for some follow-up online focus groups. After that, we will present the
key findings from this study in a report for mySociety.

To fill in the survey please use this link:
