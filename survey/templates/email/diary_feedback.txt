Dear Project Participant,

It is now over 1 year since researchers at the University of Manchester
contacted you about helping them with their research on the users of
mySociety sites. You were kind enough to contribute to the project by
completing a time diary for the study. The research team were interested
to find out about your experience of this aspect of the research and
whether you found it a positive experience in terms of allowing you
to reflect on your weekly community activities.

This was quite an innovative new method for understanding how citizens
are interacting with new technology in a richer more qualitative manner
and so your reactions to the process would be greatly appreciated. It
certainly helped us to probe our survey responses in more depth and
understand better the factors that affect whether people are likely
to involve themselves in local social and political activities.

There is no specific format for you to respond â€“ we are just
interested in your views on this mode of research, whether you would
participate in this type of study again and what benefits or costs
you would see as arising for you as a result of your participation.

You can reply to this email or use the following email address to
send your responses.

With many thanks

Professor Rachel Gibson, University of Manchester
