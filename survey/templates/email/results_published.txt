Hello there,

Recently you participated in a research project that we ran with
researchers at the University of Manchester that was designed to
look at how our sites are used, and their impact on individual
users and society more generally. The results of that research are
now available in a report produced by the Manchester research team
and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and is
available here:

https://www.mysociety.org/about/research/online-citizen-empowerment/.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your help
in conducting the research and we do hope that you find the report
interesting. Our email is survey@mysociety.org if you have comments
or feedback.

Sincerely

mySociety, Rachel Gibson, Marta Cantijoch and Silvia Galandini
